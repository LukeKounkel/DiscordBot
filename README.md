# DiscordBot
Me exploring discordpy API and advancing familiarity with python.
This is a bot for a Discord channel I wrote in 2019. Very sloppy code with no commenting or documentation, but it works. 

Many of the functions will be non-functional without the added photo files, such as fancy and high_low.
If you desperately want to use a copy of my inefficient code, the files needed for operation are few and non-complicated.
